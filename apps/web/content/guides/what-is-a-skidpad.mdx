## The gold standard of steady-state testing

A skidpad maintains constant radius and speed so lateral acceleration and yaw rate can be studied
without transient effects. VehicleLab mimics this by holding steering input and speed constant while
telemetry reveals slip angles and grip utilisation.

### Typical workflow

1. Pick a radius and target speed.
2. Apply a steering step and wait for yaw rate to stabilise.
3. Compare lateral acceleration to theoretical limits (`v^2 / r`).
4. Adjust CG height or tyre grip to see how the steady-state point moves.

### FAQs

**Why is yaw rate slightly below theory?**
Tyre slip angles reduce effective radius; the sandbox shows this through slip badges.

**What metrics should I record?**
Lateral acceleration in g, yaw rate in deg/s, and steering angle at steady state.

**How does weight distribution change results?**
More front weight usually increases understeer gradient, requiring larger steering angles.

**Can the skidpad reveal suspension issues?**
Yes. If small changes in CG height cause large balance swings, the suspension likely needs stiffer roll control.
