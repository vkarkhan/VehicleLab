## Dynamic load is never static

As a car accelerates, brakes, or corners, weight migrates across tyres. The amount depends on
mass, centre of gravity height, and roll stiffness distribution. VehicleLab renders the shifting loads
as bars so you can correlate telemetry with physical forces.

- Higher **CG height** increases transfer and reduces available grip on the unloading axle.
- Wider **track width** reduces transfer; we keep it constant in the sandbox to highlight CG effects.
- **Anti-roll bars** and spring rates control how much each axle takes from the total load shift.

### FAQs

**Why does the front load drop during a lane change?**
Because lateral acceleration builds faster than yaw, the front tyres momentarily carry less normal load while the rear compresses.

**Can I simulate trail braking?**
Yesâ€”reduce speed in the sandbox while applying steering inputs. Monitor lateral accel alongside weight bars to see the coupling.

**How does tyre grip interact with load?**
Grip increases with load but not linearly; too much transfer saturates the loaded tyres sooner, leading to understeer or oversteer.

**What should I watch in telemetry?**
Compare yaw rate build-up with the front/rear load percentages. A lagging yaw rate indicates insufficient front load.
