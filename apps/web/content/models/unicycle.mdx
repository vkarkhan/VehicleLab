## At a glance

- Idealized point-mass with a single yaw DOF -- perfect for fast sandbox prototyping.
- Ignores lateral slip and tyre load transfer, so it stays stable even at unrealistic speeds.
- Best used for layout planning, animation blocking, and controller sketches where tyre limits are secondary.
- Lightweight enough to run thousands of trajectories for Monte-Carlo studies.

## Equations

The state is $x, y, \psi$ with a constant forward speed $v$. Steering is expressed as curvature via an effective wheelbase $L_{	ext{eff}}$.

$$
\dot{x} = v \cos \psi
\qquad
\dot{y} = v \sin \psi
\qquad
\dot{\psi} = rac{v}{L_{	ext{eff}}} 	an \delta
$$

Implemented integrators:

- **semiImplicitEuler** -- fast, first order.
- **rk4** -- stable fourth-order Runge-Kutta for smooth trajectories.

## Parameters & units

| Parameter | Description | Typical range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v [m/s] | Forward speed | 0 - 60 |
| L_eff [m] | Effective wheelbase | 2.4 - 3.2 |
| dt [s] | Simulation step size | 0.005 - 0.02 |
| processNoise | Toggle additive noise | off / on |

## Assumptions & limits

- No tyre slip or lateral dynamics; the path is exactly curvature-driven.
- Gravity, load transfer, and acceleration limits are ignored.
- Suitable only for low to medium fidelity previews -- not chassis tuning.

## Canonical scenarios

1. **Constant radius skidpad** -- validates steady yaw with minimal drift.
2. **Step steer to heading** -- exposes integrator and time-step setup.
3. **Noise-injected patrol** -- enables stochastic stress testing with noise enabled.
