## Hello, Vehicle Dynamics Sandbox

Today marks the first public release of VehicleLab. The MVP focuses on rapid experimentation:

- App Router, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui deliver a responsive layout that works on desktops and tablets.
- The WebGL sandbox streams yaw rate, lateral acceleration, and slip angles as you tweak controls.
- CSV exports land in one click while PNG captures keep a tasteful watermark for Free accounts.
- Stripe (USD) and Razorpay (INR) integrations are ready for engineers who need watermark-free outputs and advanced suspension controls as they ship.

### What's next?

1. Advanced suspension editor with spring, damper, and ARB curves.
2. Preset sharing with cloud storage and collaborative comments.
3. PDF report exports that combine telemetry plots with markdown notes.

Thank you for being part of the launch. We cannot wait to see the setups you build.
