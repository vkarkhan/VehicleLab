title: "Ramp to limit"
description: "Slow steering ramp to characterise linear slope and the friction envelope."
order: 5
---

## Setup

- Apply a slow, monotonic steering ramp (\(\dot{\delta} \approx 0.1\,\text{rad/s}\)) from zero until the vehicle saturates.
- Maintain constant speed $v$ and record until lateral acceleration flattens at $\mu g$.
- Enable the friction clamp to keep axle forces bounded when comparing to tyre data.

## Theory

- Initial linear slope: $\frac{a_y}{\delta} \approx v \cdot K_{r\delta}$.
- Friction-limited lateral acceleration: $a_{y,\max} = \mu g$.
- Steer angle at limit: $\delta_\mu \approx \delta_{ss} + U \frac{\mu g}{v}$.

## Tolerances

- Linear-region slope within $10\%$ of theory.
- Peak lateral acceleration within $\pm 0.05 g$ of $\mu g$.
- Steer angle at saturation within $0.05\,\text{rad}$ of $\delta_\mu$.

## Limitations

- Requires gradual inputs; fast ramps add dynamic lag and overshoot.
- Results depend on friction coefficient $\mu$ supplied with the model params.
