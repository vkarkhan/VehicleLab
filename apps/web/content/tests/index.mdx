Welcome to the VehicleLab canonical reference suite. Each manoeuvre packages a well-understood experiment, an analytic prediction, and PASS/FAIL tolerances so you can quickly benchmark any model implementation.

- [Skidpad](/docs/tests/skidpad) &mdash; steady-state cornering on a fixed-radius path.
- [Step-steer](/docs/tests/step-steer) &mdash; small-angle step input for damping and gain.
- [Frequency response](/docs/tests/frequency) &mdash; multi-tone sweep for Bode magnitude and phase.
- [Ramp to limit](/docs/tests/ramp-limit) &mdash; slow steer ramp to probe the friction envelope.

Use the Reference Tests panel in the sandbox to run these directly. After each run, toggle the theory overlay to compare measured telemetry against the expected curves.
