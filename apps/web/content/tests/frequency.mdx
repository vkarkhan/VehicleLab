## Setup

- Command a sequence of sinusoidal steering inputs covering target frequencies $\omega = 2\pi f$.
- Use small amplitudes (\(\delta_{\text{pk}} \le 3^\circ\)) and run several cycles per frequency for steady response.
- Measure yaw rate $r$ and lateral acceleration $a_y$; compute gain $|G(j\omega)|$ and phase $\angle G(j\omega)$.

## Theory

Linear bicycle yaw dynamics yield the transfer function:

$$G_{r\delta}(s) = \frac{r(s)}{\delta(s)} = \frac{b_1 s + b_0}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_0}$$

Magnitude and phase follow the standard second-order form. DC gain matches $K_{r\delta}$ from the step-steer test.

The lateral-acceleration transfer function is $G_{a_y \delta}(s) = v G_{r\delta}(s) + s (b_1 s + b_0)/(s^2 + a_1 s + a_0)$.

## Tolerances

- DC yaw-rate gain within $5\%$ of $K_{r\delta}$.
- Peak frequency location error $\le 10\%$.
- Band-averaged magnitude RMS error $\le 15\%$.

## Limitations

- Linear transfer function assumes constant forward speed and no tyre saturation.
- At high amplitudes or with friction clamp engaged, the measured peaks will flatten and shift.
