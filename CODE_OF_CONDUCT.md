# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring environment for everyone
in the VehicleLab community. We expect all participants to follow this Code of
Conduct when interacting in the project, both online and offline.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful, inclusive, and considerate.
- Offer constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.
- Demonstrate empathy toward other community members.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement

Violations may be reported confidentially to the project maintainers at
conduct@vehicellab.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, project
maintainers may take appropriate action, including temporary or permanent bans
from the community.
