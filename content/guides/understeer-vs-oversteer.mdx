## Why balance matters

Understeer and oversteer describe how the front and rear tyres approach their grip limits.
When the front tyres saturate first the car resists turn-in (understeer); when the rear loses
traction first the car rotates aggressively (oversteer).

- **Understeer:** steering angle increases but the car takes a wider arc.
- **Oversteer:** steering angle decreases while the tail rotates toward the inside of the corner.
- **Neutral:** front and rear tyres reach peak slip angles together.

### Managing balance

1. Reposition weight using ballast or suspension preload.
2. Adjust tyre pressures and compounds to shift the peak slip angle.
3. Modify anti-roll bars to alter load transfer front vs rear.

### FAQs

**Does more front weight always mean understeer?**
No. Stiffer rear roll control or higher rear tyre stiffness can still induce oversteer.

**What role does steering input play?**
A sharp steering step can jolt the front tyres toward saturation; smoother inputs allow the rear to catch up.

**How do aero loads affect balance?**
Downforce increases both front and rear grip but the distribution of aero load is crucial. A forward aero balance can mitigate mechanical understeer.

**What is the best way to diagnose balance issues?**
Examine slip-angle traces or yaw rate in the VehicleLab sandbox. Watching how quickly the car achieves steady-state yaw will reveal tendencies.

**How should I tune for mixed conditions?**
Aim for slight understeer so that as grip falls the vehicle remains predictable.
