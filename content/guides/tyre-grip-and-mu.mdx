## Grip is not a single number

Tyre friction coefficient (μ) varies with load, temperature, and slip ratio. VehicleLab abstracts this into a single parameter so you can quickly see how
small changes cascade into lap-time potential.

- Increasing μ raises lateral acceleration and reduces slip angles.
- Lower μ exaggerates understeer gradients because front tyres saturate first.
- Pair μ sweeps with weight-transfer adjustments to replicate wet vs dry balance.

### FAQs

**Why does yaw rate saturate as μ increases?**
Because the wheelbase and steering geometry limit the achievable yaw even if grip keeps rising.

**Can I model staggered tyre compounds?**
Approximate it by adjusting weight distribution and μ together to emulate asymmetric grip.

**What export should I use for reports?**
Download the CSV trace to capture μ alongside yaw and acceleration for offline analysis.
