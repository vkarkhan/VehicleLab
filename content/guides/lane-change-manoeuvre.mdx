## The ISO double-lane-change in your browser

Quick evasive manoeuvres test how quickly the vehicle builds yaw and how well it settles afterward. Use the sandbox to overlay slip angles and weight transfer
while the pre-baked steering trace runs.

### What to observe

- **Yaw rate delay:** compare the steering input to yaw rate rise time.
- **Load transfer symmetry:** ensure the rear regains load as quickly as the front during the second lane.
- **Slip angle overshoot:** excessive rear slip indicates oversteer risk when the driver straightens the wheel.

### FAQs

**Can I shorten the manoeuvre?**
Reduce `duration` to compress the timeline and increase the challenge.

**How do dampers influence the trace?**
Softer dampers elongate oscillations; the sandbox's advanced controls (Pro) will let you tune this precisely.

**Why does lateral acceleration spike twice?**
Each steering reversal creates an opposite acceleration peak. Use the CSV export to compare magnitudes.
