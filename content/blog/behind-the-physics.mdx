## Semi-Implicit, Educational, Fast

We use a bicycle model because it captures the essence of cornering without overwhelming the browser.
The sandbox integrates yaw rate and lateral velocity at 60 Hz, sampling telemetry at 20 Hz so charts stay crisp without
hammering the main thread.

### Highlights

- Cornering stiffness reacts to μ and axle loads, clamped to mimic simple saturation.
- Weight transfer is approximated with CG height and wheelbase, giving intuitive load bars.
- Steering modes (step and sine) reveal both steady-state and transient behaviour.

### Roadmap for the solver

1. Add compliance steer and aligning torque for transient fidelity.
2. Introduce per-axle camber and toe inputs for Pro users.
3. Export the time-domain model as JSON so you can post-process in MATLAB or Python.

Your feedback shapes the numerical model—keep the ideas coming.
